1. Hello Karen! this is my video for the professionalism assignment part 2! in this video I will be outlining my goals that I 
set for myself and how I acheived those goals, as well as how I have developed professionally

	a. The goals that I have decided to work on this semester was mainly my confidence in public speaking as I have
always been bad at that and my participation in class and group work as I have typically been better with solo work rather
than group work
	b. I have made excellent progress in both of these things, I have performed presentations and the like professionally
and without betraing my nervousness within, and with group work I have taken an active role contributing to the group and even
taking a leadership role such as with the broadcast assignment (I was the host) and the case studies, where I am the one who makes the
plans for the group, scheduales meetings and directs us in our essays, as well as I am the one to motivate out group to work.
	c. My communication skills have been drastically improved over the course of this semester, I am better at presenting 
information as well as communicating within a team, I have participated activally in the class, not missing class and 
(when givin a chance) participating in the guest speaker classes. I am self-motivated and have performed this semester at
a higher level than I thought I could. I also belive that I have generally been a positive person in class and engaged where I can in 
what I can. Sometimes addmiditly I get distraced but if I was perfect in everything then I wouldnt have anything left to improve upon. 

Over all I am very pleased with the progress I have made and I just want to thank you for the help you have provided me in 
acheiving these goals over this semester, I am grateful for the skills that I had developed thanks to this class and you the
instructor. I hope you have success in your future endeavors!
