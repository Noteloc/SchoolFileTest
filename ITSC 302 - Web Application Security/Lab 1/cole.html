            <p>Well Cole is a 22 year old Student at SAIT in the ISS program, he is 6'1", has lived in Calgary his whole life and his heritage hails from England, Ukraine and Germany.
            He enjoys long walks on the beach. He once attended Mount Royal University to pursue a degree in computer science but has since reconcidered and is now more interested in cyber security.
            His hobbies include gaming, both table top and of the video variety, programming, snowboarding, rock climbing, travelling and a variety of other things that would take too long to put into here.
            Cole enjoys his classes here at SAIT, he often complained about taking classes that had nothing to do with his major when he attended MRU and is happy that all the classes he is taking here are directly related to what he is studying.
            He is looking forward to this semesters classes and is so far having a great time with web app security!
